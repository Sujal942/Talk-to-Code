# GitSense Chrome Extension

GitSense is a Chrome extension that integrates with GitHub repository pages to provide AI-powered insights and analysis of repositories.

## Features

- Injects an "ðŸ§  Analyze with GitSense" button directly onto GitHub repository pages
- Analyzes repositories to extract valuable insights:
  - Directory structure
  - Tech stack used
  - Repository summary
  - Key files and components
  - TODOs and FIXMEs
  - Visualizations (language distribution charts)

## Installation

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `gitsense-extension` directory
5. The extension should now be installed and visible in your Chrome toolbar

### Backend Setup

The extension requires a backend server to analyze repositories. The backend is built with Flask and uses the GitHub API to fetch repository data.

1. Make sure your backend server is running at `http://localhost:5000`
2. Ensure you have a valid GitHub token set in your backend's `.env` file
3. The backend should expose the following endpoints:
   - `/health` - Health check endpoint
   - `/analyze_repo` - Endpoint to analyze repositories

## Usage

1. Navigate to any GitHub repository page (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo`)
2. You'll see a "ðŸ§  Analyze with GitSense" button in the repository header
3. Click the button to analyze the repository
4. A modal will appear showing insights about the repository

## Configuration

You can configure the backend URL by clicking on the GitSense extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.
