## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔗 Frontend
Built using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**, providing a smooth, interactive, and accessible user experience.

### 🧠 Backend
Powered by **Python**, **Express.js**, the **GitHub API**, and **Gemini API** to fetch, ingest, and analyze repositories in real time.

### ⚙️ Workflow
1. Users enter a GitHub repo URL.
2. Options to exclude file types, limit file size, or customize what gets ingested.
3. GitHub API fetches and parses the codebase.
4. Gemini AI processes:
   - High-level summaries
   - File-by-file insights
   - Contribution-friendly suggestions
5. Chat system enables users to query the repo naturally.

### 🧠 Context Caching
We cache previously generated insights to:
- Reduce token usage and API costs
- Increase performance and speed
