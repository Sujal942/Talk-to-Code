### 🚀 Talk2Code by Team Meta Daters @ Hackbyte

**Talk2Code** is your AI-powered GitHub codebase assistant designed to help developers **understand, navigate, and contribute** to any code repository with ease.

#### 💡 What It Does:
Talk2Code ingests a GitHub repository and uses AI to:
- Summarize complex codebases
- Analyze structure and logic flow
- Enhance code readability
- Make onboarding for new developers/contributors easier
- Generate contribution-friendly summaries
- Help learn more about codebase with user friendly chat system

#### 🧠 How It Works:
- 🔗 **Frontend**: Built with **ExtJS** for a smooth and interactive UI.
- 🧠 **Backend**: Powered by **Python**, the **GitHub API**, and **Gemini AI API**.
- ⚙️ **Functionality**:
  - Users input a GitHub repo URL
  - You can exclude file types, limit by file size, and customize ingestion
  - Code is fetched and parsed
  - AI (via Gemini) analyzes and generates:
    - Code summaries
    - Structural insights
    - Readable outputs for faster comprehension
- 🧠 **Context Caching**: Previously generated responses are stored and reused to reduce API calls and improve performance.

#### 🌟 Why It Matters:
Whether you're an open-source contributor or a curious developer, understanding large codebases can be intimidating. **Talk2Code** breaks those barriers, making learning and contributing accessible to all.
